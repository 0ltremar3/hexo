The task is really simple: given   N   exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3,105]), followed by N integer distances D1 D2 ⋯ DN, where Di is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and DN is between the N-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer M (≤104), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 107.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in   M   lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits. 

Sample Input:

```
5 1 2 4 14 9
3
1 3
2 5
4 1
```


Sample Output:
```
3
10
7
```


#### 分析：

只有两条路可走，路2长度=总路长-路1长。比较两个路长即可得答案。
eg.v2->v4路长求法：L( v1->v4 )-L(v1->v2)，故用dis[i]存v1到vi的距离。
注意：初始化dis[1]=0；vn->v1的路长存在dis[n+1]里，但实际用不到dis[n+1]。
